// Finalize: Prior to the garbage collection of an object, the finalize method is called so that t
  //he clean-up activity is implemented. Example:
public static void main(String[] args) {
String example = new String("InterviewBit");
example = null;
System.gc(); // Garbage collector called
}
public void finalize() {
// Finalize called
}

Heterogeneous Objects: A HashSet can store heterogeneous objects, meaning you can add objects of
  different types to the same set. This is because HashSet uses the equals() and hashCode() 
  methods to manage uniqueness, and these methods can work across different types of objects.
Null Objects: A HashSet can store a single null value. Since HashSet uses a hash table internally,
  it can accommodate null as long as itâ€™s not more than one null element (because duplicates are not
  allowed in a set).

  
  Heterogeneous Objects: A TreeSet cannot store heterogeneous objects. This is because
  TreeSet internally uses a Comparator (or the natural ordering of the elements, if no 
  comparator is provided) to maintain the elements in sorted order. When you try to add objects of
  different types that are not mutually comparable, it throws a ClassCastException at runtime.

For example, trying to insert both a String and an Integer into a TreeSet would result in an exception
  since Java cannot compare a String with an Integer.

Null Objects: A TreeSet cannot store null values. Attempting to add a null object to a TreeSet will 
  result in a NullPointerException. This is because the compareTo() or compare() method (used internally
  by TreeSet to maintain order) cannot compare null with other elements, leading to the exception.
